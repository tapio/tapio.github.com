				<h2 class="featurette-heading">Graveyard <span class="muted">of old projects and experiments</span></h2>
				<p class="lead">
					I've been programming since childhood, starting with exciting choose-your-own-adventure games
					in Windows 3.1 Cardfile. After that, I made numerous small games and experiments with dialects of
					Basic (QuickBasic, VisualBasic, CoolBasic and FreeBasic). Many of those early games are
					forever lost, but I've tried to collect here the ones I could find for future me to take a nostalgic look at.

				<div class="span6">
					<img src="shots/88mm.png" class="featurette-image"  alt="" />
					<h2>88mm</h2>
					<p>
						88mm is perhaps the first game I made public in the internet. It's a really simple
						two player split screen tank game. It also received an improved "Revisited" version
						which featured e.g. AI and more effects. It formed a basis for a similar jet fighter
						game called SkyHigh, which in turn was the inspiration for my more recent Jet Pursuit.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span6">
					<img src="shots/aih.jpg" class="featurette-image"  alt="" />
					<h2>AIH - Asteroids in Hyperspace</h2>
					<p>
						I was interested in 3d math and this little game was born out of my software
						3d wireframe rendering experiments. It's a space shooter, where you shoot and avoid
						asteroids, mines and enemy ships that come at you. It had about 10 levels 3 ships
						that could be unlocked with credits obtained from shooting things and completing stages.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span6">
					<img src="shots/gridspace.png" class="featurette-image"  alt="" />
					<h2>Grid Space</h2>
					<p>
						Top-down mouse-controlled space shoot-out on a small arena. Fun little game where you shoot
						a lot of progressively harder enemies while receiving weapon upgrades. Also featured wormholes
						which try to pull everything inside. It's also somewhat moddable as all enemy and weapon parameters
						are stored in simple human-editable text files instead of hard-coding stuff into the exe.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span6">
					<img src="shots/koff.png" class="featurette-image"  alt="" />
					<h2>Knight of Faith</h2>
					<p>
						A procedural RPG with a early Ultima style 3-color graphics. It was never completed, but
						it did have a lot of the elements in place: free-form NPC discussion, working shops, simple combat
						and a world generator featuring overworld as well as several kinds of dungeons and towns.
						Since then, I have used the generator algorithms in several of my later projects.
					</p>

					<h2>Reaching for Stars!</h2>
					<p>
						I've had a long time goal to create a 4X space empire game. The first version with QBasic
						was incomplete having a cute GUI, but not much in terms of gameplay. The second incarnation
						was made with Visual Basic and, if I remember correctly, was playable though lacked diplomacy
						and technology tree. The third installment, pictured above, was mostly complete though abandoned
						with a version number of "beta3". As a strange feature, the galaxy map is 3d and needs to
						be rotated to access some parts.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="span6">
					<img src="shots/infiniverse.png" class="featurette-image"  alt="" />
					<h2>Infiniverse</h2>
					<p>
						An ambitious MMO project which generates a gigantic universe for players to explore.
						It has 6 different view levels: galaxy, starmap, solar system view, orbital view,
						planet surface and planet detail level. The most zoomed-in level is pictured above
						and it allowed creating persistent buildings. There wasn't much in terms of gameplay and
						the multiplayer server was a bit crashy, but the universe is rather gorgeous in all its ASCII
						glory. A single-player version with actual gameplay was later developed with JavaScript.
